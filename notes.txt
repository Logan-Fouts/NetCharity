- changed title on login.





index.css
- The linear-gradient is it the three colors that where given in the design document?
- removed @media (max-width: 768px)
- merged body and login (we dont have a body)
- #login removed padding we need it to be 100%
- #login removed width 80%, max-width: 200px
- Maid the username and password feels a bit larger and maid the placeholder opacity lower.
- Tried to change the logo to a div and use css but I gave up.
- asked gpt to add comments to the css file, that would be good for multiple developers to know.
